#Color Grep

This name from the `g/re/p` (or `grep`) command, used on some systems to retrieve something you want from a bigger amount of data. Just as **Color Grep** is for retrieving a single pixel color from whole image.


##How to use:
1. Access **<http://danielfilho.github.com/Color-Grep/>**.
2. Drag some files from your computer and drop on the circle.
3. Click wherever you want to capture the exact pixel's color.
